the first category of operators were going to look at is arithmetic operators we use this for performing calculations just like the calculations we have in mathematics so here we have two variables X and Y let's take a look at all the arithmetic operators in JavaScript so I'm going to do a console.log here's the first example x + y that is the Edition operator so this is arithmetic operators usually take to operate in this case X and Y and then produce a new value one we have here is x + y is what we refer to as an expression in JavaScript so an expression is something that produces a value so here's the additional operator we also have subtraction we have multiplication division and remainder of division so just like the basic arithmetic operators we have in mathematics we have a new operator in JavaScript that is exponentiation it's indicated by two stars and that is X to the power of why so these are pretty straightforward we have two additional arithmetic operators that are a little bit more tricky so I'm going to focus on those for now I'm going to comment out this field lines you can do that by selecting a piece of code and pressing command and slash on Mac or control and slash on windows so these two other operators are increment and decrement operators let's see how they work so increment is indicated by 2 plus signs and depending on where we put the plus signs this operator will behave differently so I'm going to do a console that log of x x is initialized to 10 so if I say the changes we see 10 on the console now if I put the increment operator before X the value of x will be incremented by one first and then we will see that on the console let's take a look so save the changes see we get 11 in contrast if you put this operator after X we'll see X on the console first and then the value of x will be incremented by one have a look save the changes we see 10 but at this point x is incremented by 1 so if you do another console that log of x now we should see 11 have a look here it is the decrement operator is pretty similar so instead of two plus signs we have to minus signs and here I'm going to apply this before X so we're going to decrement the value of x by 1 and then displayed on the console so for this demo I'm going to comment out these two lines have a look we see nine on the console because these operator first and then displayed on the console so these are all the arithmetic operators we have in JavaScript to recap we have addition subtraction multiplication division remainder of division exponentiation which is X to the power of why as well as increment and decrement operators
