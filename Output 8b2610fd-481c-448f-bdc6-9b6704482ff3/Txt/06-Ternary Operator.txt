now let's take a look at the ternary or conditional operator which is one of my favorite operators in JavaScript let's imagine we want to implement a room like this if a customer has more than 100 points they are a gold customer otherwise they are a silver customer how do we implement this well first I'm going to start by declaring a variable to keep track of the number of points so let's say 110 now we want to declare another variable called type that represents the type of customers and here's where we use the ternary or conditional operator so this is how it works first we start with a condition we want to compare the number of points with 100 so we use the comparison operator here points greater than 100 now as you learn early this expression produces a Boolean so the result of this expression is either true or false that depending on the result we're going to set this type of variable to a different value so here we add a question mark not if this expression evaluates to true that means this is a gold customer so we want to set type to Gold otherwise if this expression and values to false we want to set the type to Silver so this is the ternary or conditional operator we start with a condition if that condition a value is to True will use this value otherwise we'll use this other value now let's log type on the console save the changes so we have a gold customer in contrast if I change the number of points to 90 and save the changes will get a silver customer
