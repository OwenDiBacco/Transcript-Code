the second category of operators were going to look at is assignment operators you have already seen an example of an assignment operator so here we are using the simple assignment operator to assign a value in this case 102x what we have a few more assignment operators let me show you so in the last lecture you learn about the increment operator with this with increment the value of x by 1 this expression here is exactly equivalent to this so we read the value of x add to it and then using the assignment operator assigned this new value to X but what if in this example instead of adding one to X we want to add let's say five well this increment operator will not work so how can we do that well this is one simple way but we have a short hair we can use the Edition the assignment operator like this so line 5 and 9 for our exactly the same here's another example let's imagine we want to multiply the value of x by 3 so we can write it like this x equals x * 3 or we can use the multiplication assignment operator like this so all the others you'll learn about in the last lecture addition subtraction division multiplication and the remainder operators all of them have this combination with the assignment operator
