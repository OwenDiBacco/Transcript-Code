all right now let's take a look at comparison operators as the name implies we use this operators to compare the value of a variable with something else so here we have X set to 1 let's look at the first comparison operator that is greater than so we want to check if x is greater than 0 I'm going to save the changes look what we get true so the result of an expression that includes a comparison operator is a Boolean it's true or false now let's look at another example the second operator is greater than or equal to so we can change 0 to 1:00 to see if x is greater than or equal to one obviously it is so if you save the changes we get through again the other operators are very similar so we have less than or equal to now let's save the changes look again on the console so the third item is false because X is not less than one it's less than or equal to one that's why we got false here so this four operators we have here we refer to them as relational operators we also have a quality operators so we can check to see if x is equal to 1 so we have triple equal signs let's save the changes obviously X is one that's why we get true if you want to check if X is not equal to a given value you replace the first equal sign with an exclamation mark so let's save the changes the result of the last expression is false because X is equal to 1 so this are all the comparison operators in JavaScript
